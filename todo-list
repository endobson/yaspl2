In progress:

Things to do:

In libraries:
Make subbytes/bytes-copy! fast
decimal-bytes->integer should return a monadic result
change all mains to accept environment.

In compiler:

Make lint warnings be in order not reverse order
Make polymorphic calls work in more cases.
Make error messages for imports show all at the same time.
Check bytes length when doing reads/writes
Cond statements
Add : to type definitions
Provide better location info for error messages.
Make error messages for strings better
Make error message for case with multiple bodies in a clause better.
Make error messages for function definitions with missing type variables better.
Make defining the same function twice an error
Make defining the same argument name twice an error
Make #; comments work

In test suites:
Provide better scoping of error messages.

In linter:
Make lint work on yaspl_test rules
Warn about unused local variables.
Warn about unused defined functions.
Warn about unused datatypes.
Warn about unsorted imported modules
Warn about unsorted imported types/variables/patterns
Do global analysis to find unused exported bindings
