In progress:

Things to do:

In libraries:
Make subbytes/bytes-copy! fast
dict-keys should return a set

In compiler:
Make export of unbound types/values/patterns an error
Make import not allow importing of patterns that are not exported.
Handle bad input better than panic
Check bytes length when doing reads/writes
Cond statements
Add : to type definitions
Provide better location info for error messages.
Make error messages for strings better
Make error message for case with multiple bodies in a clause better.
Make error messages for function definitions with missing type variables better.
Make defining the same function twice an error
Make defining the same argument name twice an error

In test suites:
Provide better scoping of error messages.
