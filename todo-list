In progress:
Making the libraries parseable by the compiler
Working on parsing into a module structure.

Things to do:

In libraries:
Make subbytes/bytes-copy! fast
Handle escape sequences

In compiler:
Handle bad input better than panic
Check bytes length when doing reads/writes

In interpreter:
Cond statements
Tuple types
Ensure variable scoping
Add : to type definitions
Provide better scoping of error messages.
Remove overheads from boxing
Make error messages for strings better
Allow annotation expression

In test suites:
Provide better scoping of error messages.
Parse all the existing libraries
