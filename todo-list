In progress:
Making the libraries parseable by the compiler
Through sexp parsing

Things to do:

In libraries:
Make subbytes/bytes-copy! fast
Make map work.

In compiler:
Support if and booleans
Handle bad input better than panic

In interpreter:
Add byte literals
Cond statements
Nested patterns
Tuple types
Ensure variable scoping
_ wild card pattern
Add : to type definitions
Provide better scoping of error messages.
Remove overheads from boxing

In test suites:
Provide better scoping of error messages.
Parse all the existing libraries
