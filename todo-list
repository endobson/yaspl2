In progress:
Making the libraries parseable by the compiler
Through sexp parsing

Things to do:


In compiler:
Support if and booleans
Handle bad input better than panic

In interpreter:
Cond statements
Nested patterns
Tuple types
Ensure variable scoping
_ wild card pattern
Add : to type definitions
Provide better scoping of error messages.

In test suites:
Provide better scoping of error messages.
Parse all the existing libraries
